# Problems Found and Fixed

## 1. Missing Dependencies
**Problem**: Django and other required packages were not installed.
**Solution**: 
- Activated virtual environment
- Installed Django and all required packages
- Updated Pillow to a compatible version (11.3.0)

## 2. Missing Environment Variables
**Problem**: No `.env` file with required environment variables.
**Solution**: Created `.env` file with:
- SECRET_KEY
- DEBUG=True
- STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY
- STRIPE_SECRET_KEY

## 3. Django Allauth Deprecation Warnings
**Problem**: Several allauth settings were deprecated in newer versions.
**Solution**: Updated settings.py with new allauth configuration:
- Replaced `ACCOUNT_EMAIL_REQUIRED` with `ACCOUNT_SIGNUP_FIELDS`
- Replaced `ACCOUNT_AUTHENTICATION_METHOD` with `ACCOUNT_LOGIN_METHODS`
- Replaced `ACCOUNT_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS_LIMIT/TIMEOUT` with `ACCOUNT_RATE_LIMITS`

## 4. Missing Database Migrations
**Problem**: Database models were not migrated.
**Solution**: 
- Ran `python manage.py makemigrations store`
- Ran `python manage.py migrate`

## 5. Stripe API Key Error Handling
**Problem**: Stripe initialization could fail if settings were not properly configured.
**Solution**: Added try-catch block in views.py for Stripe API key initialization.

## 6. Missing Context Processors
**Problem**: Templates expected `categories` and `cart` variables that weren't always available.
**Solution**: Created context processors:
- `categories_processor`: Makes categories available globally
- `cart_processor`: Makes cart available globally

## 7. Incorrect URL Namespacing
**Problem**: Redirect URLs in views were missing the 'store:' namespace.
**Solution**: Fixed all redirect calls to use proper namespaced URLs:
- `redirect('cart_detail')` → `redirect('store:cart_detail')`
- `redirect('product_list')` → `redirect('store:product_list')`
- etc.

## 8. Order Number Generation Issue
**Problem**: Order model tried to use `self.id` before the object was saved.
**Solution**: Updated order number generation to use timestamp and UUID instead of relying on the object's ID.

## 9. Missing Templates
**Problem**: `payment.html` and `payment_success.html` templates were missing.
**Solution**: Created both templates with proper Stripe integration and success handling.

## 10. Missing CSRF Token
**Problem**: Payment form needed CSRF token for AJAX requests.
**Solution**: 
- Added `{% csrf_token %}` to base template
- Added `@csrf_exempt` decorator to payment view for AJAX requests

## 11. Missing Sample Data
**Problem**: No products or categories to display on the site.
**Solution**: Created management command `create_sample_data` with:
- 5 categories (Electronics, Clothing, Books, Home & Garden, Sports)
- 11 sample products with realistic data

## 12. Missing Superuser
**Problem**: No admin user to access Django admin.
**Solution**: Created superuser with username 'admin' and email 'admin@example.com'.

## Current Status
✅ All problems have been resolved
✅ Django server is running on http://127.0.0.1:8000
✅ Sample data has been created
✅ Admin user has been created
✅ All templates are present and functional
